This repository contains R scripts and data for performing survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the log-rank test. The analysis compares survival distributions between premenopausal and postmenopausal groups, assessing whether there is a statistically significant difference in survival times between these groups. Key components include data preprocessing, survival curve estimation, and hypothesis testing using the log-rank method. This repository is intended for those interested in statistical methods for survival analysis and their application in medical research.
